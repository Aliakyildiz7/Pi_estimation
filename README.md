# Pi_estimation
This code finds the closest estimation of pi number as a fraction of two integers, iterating through up to a user_input denominator.
When max_denominator is adjusted, following results were obtained:

- With the max denominator value of 10; the closest integers are 22 / 7 = 3.142857142857143
- With the max denominator value of 100; the closest integers are 311 / 99 = 3.1414141414141414
- With the max denominator value of 1000; the closest integers are 355 / 113 = 3.1415929203539825

- Value of pi as built in the math library of Python is 3.141592653589793
